# Security Policy

## 1. Supported Versions

Currently, the project is in a pre-release research phase. We support the latest commit on the `main` branch.

## 2. Data Privacy & Credentials

### 2.1 Public Data
This project currently relies on **publicly available market data** (Yahoo Finance). No private credentials or API keys are required for the default configuration.

### 2.2 Future API Keys
If future versions integrate proprietary data vendors (e.g., Bloomberg, Polygon.io):
*   **NEVER** commit API keys to version control.
*   Use Environment Variables (e.g., `POLYGON_API_KEY`) to inject credentials at runtime.
*   Use `.env` files (added to `.gitignore`) for local development.

## 3. Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., code injection via data inputs, dependency vulnerabilities), please do **not** open a public issue.

Since a formal security team is not yet established, please contact the repository maintainer directly via email (placeholder: `maintainer@example.com`).

## 4. Execution Risks
*   **No Auto-Execution:** This software is a **decision support tool**. It does not currently contain code to execute trades automatically with a broker.
*   **User Responsibility:** Any trading based on the signals generated by this software is at the sole risk of the user.
